  This demo is based on the GD32VF103V-EVAL-V1.0 board, it shows how to configure the 
TIMER0 peripheral to generate three complementary TIMER0 signals(for BLDC) with dead 
time.

  TIMER0CLK is fixed to systemcoreclock, the TIMER0 prescaler is equal to 108 so the 
TIMER0 counter clock used is 1MHz.
  
  Channel change sequence: 
  AB`->AC`->BC`->BA`->CA`->CB`
step1: 1-0  0-1  0-0 (CH0-CH0N  CH1-CH1N  CH2-CH2N)
step2: 1-0  0-0  0-1 (CH0-CH0N  CH1-CH1N  CH2-CH2N)
step3: 0-0  1-0  0-1 (CH0-CH0N  CH1-CH1N  CH2-CH2N)
step4: 0-1  1-0  0-0 (CH0-CH0N  CH1-CH1N  CH2-CH2N)
step5: 0-1  0-0  1-0 (CH0-CH0N  CH1-CH1N  CH2-CH2N)
step6: 0-0  0-1  1-0 (CH0-CH0N  CH1-CH1N  CH2-CH2N)

  Connect the TIMER0 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
  - TIMER0_CH0  pin(PA8)
  - TIMER0_CH0N pin(PB13)
  - TIMER0_CH1  pin(PA9)
  - TIMER0_CH1N pin(PB14)
  - TIMER0_CH2  pin(PA10)
  - TIMER0_CH2N pin(PB15)
